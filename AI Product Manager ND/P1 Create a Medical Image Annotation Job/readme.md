# Loan Data from Prosper
## by Svajune Klimasauskaite


## Goal

The goal is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. Therefore we want to build a classification system that
* Can help flag serious cases
* Quickly identify healthy cases
* And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors.

## Dataset

The dataset is a modified version of this [Kaggle chest x-ray](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset, with most labels removed. Every piece of data is a chest x-ray image. A typical, labeled image is shown below.
