# Exploring Weather Trends
## by Svajune Klimasauskaite


## Goal

This project analyzes local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

## Dataset

There are three database:
>city_list - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database. Look through them in order to find the city nearest to you.
>city_data - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
>global_data - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).

## Summary

>Global temperature shows temperature changing characteristics much earlier than my selected cities. 
>Global temperature didn’t cross below the average line from 1920, while my selected cities from 1980 and 1990.
>The differences between the highest and lowest points are shrinking with warming tendencies, however for global temperature it started around 1900, while for my selected cities around 2000.   
>Correlation coefficient differs per city. Different cities has different correlation coefficient with Global temperature, however the reasons are not obviously clear. It could lead to a further investigation.
