# No-show appointments
## by Svajune Klimasauskaite


## Goal

This project is connected with the Introduction to Data Analysis course. I'll brainstorm some questions I could answer using the data set, then start answering those questions.

## Dataset

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. 

## Summary

>6% of the patients had a single visit that was missed. Majority of the patients were babies.
>17% of the regular patients (more than 1 visit) missed an appointment at least once. Majority of the patients were babies.
>Neighbourhoods with a higher participation in scholarship program, might have a higher percentage of missed appointments.
>Patients with less health problems (not regular patients or with less number of visits) are tend to miss an appointments more.
>The percentage of missed appointment increases dramatically when the waiting time is longer than 1 week.
>SMS reminders might have an impact when the waiting time is longer than 1 week.
