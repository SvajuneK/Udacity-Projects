# Analyze A/B Test Results
## by Svajune Klimasauskaite


## Goal

The goal is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. I'll work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Summary

In this work, I implemented 3 different statistical tests to appreciate if the difference is significant.
* Simulation, 
* Z-test, 
* Logistic regression
