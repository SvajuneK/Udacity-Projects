# Analyze A/B Test Results
## by Svajune Klimasauskaite


## Goal

The goal is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. I'll work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Dataset

* Group Description. 
Most experiments try to determine whether some type of experimental treatment (or important factor) has a significant effect on an outcome. Subjects who are chosen to participate in the experiment are typically divided into two groups: a treatment group and a control group.
**The treatment group** consists of participants who receive the experimental treatment whose effect is being studied.
**The control group** consists of participants who do not receive the experimental treatment being studied. Instead, they get a fake treatment or no treatment at all, depending on the situation.
In the end, the responses of those in the treatment group are compared with the responses from the control group to look for differences that are statistically significant (unlikely to have occurred just by chance).
* Conversion Description. 
Conversion funnel decides whether the website gets good traffic and if it converts more visitors. Businesses want visitors to take an action (also called a conversion) on their website and the rate at which a website can drive this is called its "conversion rate". The more optimized your funnel, higher is the visitorsâ€™ chance to convert.
