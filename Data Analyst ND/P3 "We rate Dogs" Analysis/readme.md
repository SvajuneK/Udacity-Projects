# We Rate Dogs
## by Svajune Klimasauskaite


## Goal

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

## Dataset

>Enhanced Twitter Archive - The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything.
>Additional Data via the Twitter API - Back to the basic-ness of Twitter archives: retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. Fortunately, this additional data can be gathered by anyone from Twitter's API.
>Image Predictions File - A table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction
