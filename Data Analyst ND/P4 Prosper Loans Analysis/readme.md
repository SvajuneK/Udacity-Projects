# Loan Data from Prosper
## by Svajune Klimasauskaite


## Goal

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying findings will be through transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

## Dataset

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
